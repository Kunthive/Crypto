# Changes Made

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Removed All Emojis from Application
- **navigation.tsx**: Removed all emoji icons (🏠, 📚, 🎯, 💬, 📰) from the navigation component
  - Cleaned up desktop menu to show text-only buttons
  - Cleaned up mobile menu to show text-only navigation links
  - Removed emoji logo from header, kept just text branding
- **README.md**: Changed emoji bullet points to standard bullet points

### 2. Fixed Vercel Deployment Issue
The problem was that pages were trying to access the filesystem at runtime in Vercel's serverless environment, which doesn't work. Fixed by:

- **Added `export const dynamic = 'force-static'`** to all main pages:
  - `app/page.tsx` (Homepage)
  - `app/archive/page.tsx` (Archive)
  - `app/intent/page.tsx` (Intent/About)
  - `app/contact/page.tsx` (Contact)
  - `app/newsletter/[id]/page.tsx` (Newsletter pages)

- **Added `export const dynamicParams = false`** to newsletter pages to ensure only pre-built pages are served

This ensures all pages are statically generated at build time, so the reports will load properly on Vercel.

## Build Results
- Successfully builds with 134 static pages
- All newsletters are pre-rendered at build time
- No runtime filesystem access needed

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel - the reports should now load correctly
2. The application now has a professional, emoji-free design
3. All pages are statically generated for optimal performance
