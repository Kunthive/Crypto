GM! Welcome to Milk Road PRO – the crypto newsletter that’s as steady as an anchor in a stormy market. ⚓

You’ve probably noticed that the crypto markets are finally moving, though not in the direction we all hoped. 😢

The last week was quite brutal for crypto. **The total market cap dropped over 28%, wiping out more than $670B in value.** Ouch. 🤕

While the market has seen a nice rebound throughout this week, the price action raises some important questions: 

**What's really going on? Should you adjust your portfolio? Is it time to play defense?** 🤔

We figured you might be asking these questions too, so we want to provide some answers in this report.

**Here's what** **we'll cover today:**

- What's causing this market madness, and what are our thoughts on it?
    
- Which token has demonstrated impressive strength?
    
- Why has $ETH dropped so much? And will it last?
    
- What will influence the markets in the coming months?
    

But before we dive into it, let's talk a bit about the market volatility. 📉📈

We all know that crypto's **wild swings can be a tough pill to swallow —** especially when it's headed south. 💊 

While we all dream of those exciting 5x-10x gains, we have to accept that **downside volatility is part of the game too**. 💯

Remember, there's a bigger picture to consider!

Volatility is a major concern for traders, but for investors? **Not so much.** Investors usually always keep a long-term perspective.

Does this chart look that bad to you? 🤷

**We started the year at $1.59T**, so we're still up year-to-date. It might feel rough, but it's not as bad as it seems.

**So, the main message is this**: Don't worry about short-term volatility. Always keep the bigger picture in mind. 🖼️

However, **charts don't always tell the whole story**. To truly understand what's happening, we need to dig deeper. ⛏️

So, let's get into what’s going on in the markets. 

We already discussed the 5 specific reasons for this [market madness in Monday’s free newsletter](https://milkroad.com/daily/wtf-just-rocked-the-crypto-world/?utm_source=themilkroad.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pro-navigating-this-market-madness) and again on [The Milk Road Show.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfSDvLoRAY8&utm_source=themilkroad.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pro-navigating-this-market-madness) 🎙️

However, today we’re going to share the **PRO team's opinions on each reason**, before sharing our analysis on the current markets.

## **USA GOING INTO RECESSION ↘️**

It seems like one indicator is **igniting all the fear and panic in the markets: the Sahm rule**.

The Sahm rule is an **early recession indicator**.

When the 3-month average unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above the low of the previous 12 months, **it signals that the economy is in, or about to enter, a recession**. 😱 

Since 1950, the Sahm rule has only had **one false positive** (in 1959), and even then, a **recession followed six months later.**

**And guess what?**

Friday's labor market data reported that:

- Job growth in the U.S. slowed significantly
    
- The unemployment rate rose more than expected 
    

As a result, the **Sahm indicator just surpassed the 0.5 threshold**.

With the Sahm indicator at 0.53, **does it mean we are headed for a recession?** 🧐

**Slow down**— let's look at some **broader market factors** to see if things are really that bad before jumping to conclusions. 🦘

[![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd2vtLhvdzHNJy9uPIIQfJ9AH6YvEzwn43y5R6c8Fi8El6J0lsQNsFFbL06VGP0serEl_EXnQQeL7J5sUvD_l4Kppt9h7TgrJn_wi1Lz0JyQk9bnNBU1bLtRkQ5S3O9DLRX7P4Xcnfqr_6tX--moUcXSDKC?key=6aRiYE94AqcUfOYOxfPrDg)](https://x.com/JustinWolfers/status/1820289997670383930/photo/1?utm_source=themilkroad.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pro-navigating-this-market-madness)

This chart highlights **key indicators used by economists and analysts** to assess the **likelihood of a recession**. 

So, while the Sahm rule was triggered, **we don't see significant declines in the broader set of indicators above to suggest the economy is heading into a recession.** 

Moreover the Fed has a **significant tool at its disposal**: it can cut interest rates if needed. ✂️

So now the main concerns are growing that the Federal Reserve is falling behind in providing policy support for a slowing U.S. economy.

It seems **the narrative of bad news being good news is over.** Now, bad news is really just bad news again. 

Maybe the markets are finally coming to their senses. 🤣

The market turmoil is **fueling expectations for more Fed rate cuts this year.** 

Here is a table showing the probabilities:

[![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdXZuB38VycKcKoW2qbosy_HY-g2ocn1dR3clVLAFrGSfG579L7ajFxnkKMIFlO_teiwmnmxtDzhTL62MK4NY7YZh53fhMsL5AJ7vRRNjWsG9rbRNY6N8dr8Kfu-_d2nxNpcF_YKs1zy0ojEdKz2Km-5shX?key=6aRiYE94AqcUfOYOxfPrDg)](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?utm_source=themilkroad.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pro-navigating-this-market-madness)

The market assigns a **76.5% probability of two rate cuts in September**, from the current 5.25-5.50% to 4.75-5.00% target rate. 

There is also a **41.3% chance of four cuts and a 39.1% chance of five cuts** by the end of the year. 

Remember, the more cuts, **the cheaper the money****.** This helps the economy grow and **boosts the prices of risk-on assets.**

But there are few other things which probably added more fuel to the fire: 

- Berkshire Hathaway **reduced its stake in Apple by nearly 50%** **in Q2,** putting their cash stockpile above $270B.
    
- Some major players like Google and Amazon report **weaker-than-expected Q2 results.**
    
- Intel cut 15,000 jobs and Nvidia may delay its new AI chip indicating a **cooling of the AI rally.**
    

Our conclusion: Overall, nothing has fundamentally changed over the past few days. It seems like **some** **market** **participants** **overreacted.**

According to JP Morgan, retail investors have been **aggressive net sellers**, while institutional investors have **taken the opportunity** to buy the dip. 

**The message is clear**: retail investors are panic-selling while big players are accumulating. 

**Which side do you want to be on?**

We feel like this chart is really spot on. 🎯

But before you get too excited, we need to discuss other events that have impacted the markets, because it **wasn't just the U.S. causing the madness**.

## **JAPAN HIKING INTEREST RATES** 🗻

Japan is also to blame, as **its central bank recently increased interest rates**. 💹

Central banks are changing the interest rates all the time, **why is it a big deal?** 

Well most central banks are, but not the BoJ (Bank of Japan), until just recently. 😂

**Japan’s central bank has kept interest rates near or below zero for nearly a decade****,** aiming to spur inflation in a deflationary economy. 🤔

It now seems they have successfully combated deflation, as prices are steadily increasing. 

So the Bank of Japan **increased its key interest rate to “around 0.25%”**, up from the previous range of 0% to 0.1%.

This rate hike wouldn't be as troublesome **if the close-to-zero policy hadn't lasted for that long**, creating significant leverage in the system! 🏦

**People could borrow yen at a rock-bottom 0% interest rate and reinvest in USD for a 5% yield.** 

Easy money, right? 

But once the **conditions of this trade changed**, it caused a significant impact on the markets!

This is especially true given that this trade is estimated to **involve $4T—more than double the current cryptocurrency market cap.** 🤯

Just look at the chart of USD/JPY:

[![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdPfYQgQik06WYceTMUDV6CWGHyj2BX6sATRCdj35vaWji9b6f4waBltYFmwdRmjIa6vyoJG0G9nHb5ogXHn5WoqO_s8SecCBF0Rhc3lc5AC5sqBMvwM5s9OIIsKbU2dq0Xw2nQ1TmFQ1xZC7eZQjJJqpA?key=6aRiYE94AqcUfOYOxfPrDg)](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/RtAZ2wsj/?symbol=FX_IDC%3AJPYUSD&utm_source=themilkroad.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pro-navigating-this-market-madness)

The JPY has risen 14% against the USD recently, making the yen more expensive when using USD to buy it.

**Just a reminder:** this is forex, not crypto, yet we're still seeing significant volatility. 🎢

The issue isn't just the higher interest rate—**it’s the rapid increase in the value of your outstanding loan**. 

AKA you'll now **need 14% more USD to repay it.**

Imagine you were buying US stocks, but there’s fear and uncertainty about an impending US recession. 

**The yen could continue to strengthen against the USD due to differing central bank policies.**

**While Japan is raising interest rates**, causing more buying pressure on the yen and decreasing its supply, **the US is expected to do the opposite**.

So, how confident would you be in this trade? 😮‍💨

Probably not very confident, and you **might start selling the US stocks or other assets you bought with this strategy.** 

And that’s where we are now. 

**But** **perhaps it’s not as bad as it looks**. Japan is aware of the carry trade and its impact on the markets, especially on US dollars.

To address this, the BOJ launched a program called 'U.S. Dollar Funds-supplying operations' to ensure there are enough U.S. dollars in Japan. 

This move aims to **stabilize the market and support international transactions.** ⚖️

**While it doesn’t reduce the selling pressure** (prices can keep going down), it helps to stabilize the financial system, and that’s far more important. 🔑

If Japan is actively cooperating with the US to resolve and slowly unwind this trade without destabilizing the markets, **we can** **hope that we have already seen the worst**. 🙏

**Update:** With summer in full swing and U.S. elections approaching, everyone is hoping for an uptrend. 📈

**Investors are clearly unhappy with the current situation and declining markets.** However, if the BOJ announces they won't raise rates further to help stabilize the market, it would certainly help. 

And guess what just happened? 

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfHgpZbN5-7PZ53dmoPaX5-SEa8e5kyxvXlx_WtWyxOp8I__YxUTjcCoXwbwNpIhRk_Iw240lp8BoPzgxow8jZW-i1Vq_nbfGVESjczO4x1SrfZsvHTe8i5mlrLXeHfdI9h9cOgD1uavllSHrd8fwTQ9PMT?key=6aRiYE94AqcUfOYOxfPrDg)

Yes, Japan just said **no further hikes for now**. 

So for the time being, we don't need to worry about this, which likely was the **biggest negative impact on the markets.** 📉

However, there were a **few other negative news stories** that helped spark fear in people.

## **ESCALATING ISRAEL AND IRAN TENSIONS ⚠️**

Tensions in the Middle East are soaring as Iran and its allies prepare to respond to the assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and a key Hezbollah commander in Beirut, which Israel is blamed for. 

These incidents have triggered vows of revenge from Iran and allies, **raising fears of a regional war.**

Our take: Could a war in the Middle East impact your investments? **Absolutely.** 

Should we be really worried and reassess our strategy? **No.**

Why? **It’s nearly impossible to predict geopolitical events.** 

If you based your investments on the potential of war, you would never have an opportunity to invest. Instead, we feel it’s a short term concern that doesn’t impact our long term thesis. 📔

**Speaking of leaders...** The odds for who will be the next U.S. President are shifting rapidly.

## **TRUMP'S DECLINING CHANCES** 📉

According to Polymarket, Trump's odds of winning the presidency this November are dropping. 

**Since Trump is seen as the markets' top choice**, his declining chances are causing concern among investors.

This could alter our bullish targets for this cycle. 

**Trump, being the businessman he is, will likely boost both business and crypto**, making him a favorite of Wall Street, big institutions, and the crypto community. 🤭

Kamala Harris, his main rival, **might not be as bullish for the markets, especially for crypto.** 

However, even if Kamala wins, it might only slightly lower our targets for this cycle.

Here's our take: **With Trump, we're super bullish. With Kamala, we're bullish.**

And because we all are crypto investors, we must also address the latest news in the crypto markets.

After the German government sales, Mt. Gox distributions, and Grayscale outflows, **you** **might have thought we'd see an end to the selling pressure.** 

We hoped for the same, but unfortunately, that's not the case. **There's a new big seller in the market.**

## **JUMP SELLING CRYPTO** 🦘

Jump Crypto, **one of the biggest market makers in crypto**, is transferring millions of dollars worth of digital assets to exchanges. 

This potentially increases selling pressure across crypto markets. 😨

People speculate there are **two reasons why Jump Crypto is selling** even on Sundays with low liquidity: 

1. They might be getting a **margin call** in traditional markets and need liquidity over the weekend.
    
2. They could be exiting the crypto business due to **regulatory issues** related to Terra Luna.
    

In the past 10 days, Jump Crypto has **sold $377M** **worth of $ETH and plans to sell an additional $104M.**

Even though **it's a smaller supply overhang**, it can intensify the selling pressure when markets are falling rapidly. 😡

It **feels like we can't escape these frustrating supply overhangs** as new supply keeps entering the market. However, this might lead to a quicker uptrend once the selling pressure eases. 🎢

Alright, so now we understand what caused the market turmoil and why all crypto is down. 

However, there is one token we want to highlight as a **clear winner in this meltdown. 🏆**

## **SOLANA SHOWS STRENGTH** 💪

**There's a general rule in times like these:** major tokens usually outperform everything else, meaning they fall slower than other coins. 

Since we don't hold $BTC, our biggest token by market cap is $ETH. 

So we expected $ETH to hold strong during this period while other tokens underperform it. 

**But $SOL showed even more strength** and is doing new ATHs every day against $ETH.

P.S. We have two PRO reports discussing Solana:

1. [**Is $SOL About to Explode?**](https://themilkroad.beehiiv.com/p/solana-price-prediction-and-bull-market-strategy?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter): We examined Solana's fundamentals that aren't yet priced in.
    
2. [**3 Ways to Determine a Token's Fair Price**](https://themilkroad.beehiiv.com/p/3-ways-to-determine-a-tokens-fair-price?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter): We compared $SOL and $ETH and predict SOL/ETH reaching 0.3.

Based on our previous PRO reports, **Solana's performance isn't that surprising.** 🥱

However, it's important to highlight it as it remains quite impressive.

When people panic, they **tend to sell tokens they have lower confidence in.** 

This suggests that most market participants are confident in Solana and **were either hesitant to sell or took the opportunity to buy Solana at a "discount."** 

That’s probably the kind of token you want to hold.🤫 

**And here’s the catch:** We believe we know what’s holding back $ETH's price.

## **ETHEREUM SELLING PRESSURE** 💎

There is ongoing selling pressure on $ETH:

- Grayscale average daily outflows of $190M of $ETH 
    
- Jump Crypto selling $30M of $ETH daily over the last 10 days
    

Those are averages, but that's **over $200M in known sell pressure**. 

Even ETF inflows ($150M) haven't been able to exceed that, **which is why $ETH's price remains where it is**.

However, **we don't think this will last much longer**:

- Jump will soon be out of $ETH
    
- Grayscale outflows from $ETHE might take another 2-3 weeks before the majority of the sell pressure is gone
    

We can learn from Bitcoin. Only about 50% of $GBTC holders wanted to exit their position (see the chart below), and a **similar ratio could be true for $ETHE**. 

[![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd0zHCKGaPp3Lnz1a7ibLaWWJhWBoYRD9WXtMyTFXmDYDyf0S8B1A0LAAIKao8QqaEeAVEkUC7PZn6QxmnCJJqSTnZCmvTmqFcOIVwlESp0w6mW_53oOwtT2l-XvbakaN2yALo5gIfOonr_r5YU69Iei3ol?key=6aRiYE94AqcUfOYOxfPrDg)](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/ethereum-plunges-further-as-genesis-trading-begins-repayment-of-creditors-202408030112?utm_source=themilkroad.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pro-navigating-this-market-madness)

We saw 26% $ETHE outflow in just 12 days. If this continues, we could reach around **50% of $ETHE being converted in 2-3 weeks.** 

After that, the heavy selling should stop, and we could see more buying.🚀 

And lastly, there is a reason why we think that there will be **much more buying then selling in the upcoming months.** 

## **UPCOMING CATALYST - NEW LIQUIDITY** 🚰

We talk about liquidity a lot because **we believe all economic cycles are driven by liquidity cycles**.

We are likely about to start feeling the **effects of growing liquidity** in the markets.

Actually something big is launching this week: **the U.S. Treasury Buyback Program** 🏦

This initiative will pour **$50B into the markets over the next three months**, starting with $8.5B in August, $31.5B in September, and $10B in October.

**And this is just the beginning.** Other central banks are expected to print much more money in the coming months to boost their economies. 🔜

For example, China's central bank adds assets to its balance sheet and spends heavily in the second half of each year, **increasing market liquidity**.

This is obviously very positive for the markets. So let's take a closer look at the **overall global liquidity entering the markets.** 👀

The recent weeks show a **pretty steep growth in global liquidity.** 

And we all know how markets react to increased liquidity, don't we?

Well let's just say that Bitcoin likes liquidity. 😝

Alright, that was a lot of information, so **let's summarize and draw some conclusions**.

## **OUR CONCLUSIONS 👇**

The last few days were **quite volatile for the markets** due to the reasons mentioned above. 

Here are the key points:

- We examined **other recession indicators**, which don't signal anything worrisome.
    
- **Japan increased rates causing market panic** but then announced no further hikes in the foreseeable future..
    
- **Tensions in the Middle East** are concerning but likely won't have a major impact on the markets.
    
- **Trump's declining odds** are more significant to us. While the elected president won't stop liquidity flow into the markets, crypto adoption might slow if Kamala is elected.
    
- The **ongoing sell pressure for $ETH**, driven by Grayscale outflows and Jump Crypto, won't last much longer.
    
- **Solana has shown strength** during these tough times, increasing our confidence in it.
    
- Most central banks are about to start printing more money, **increasing global liquidity**, which tends to be a good time for investors.
    

It seems the markets, particularly retail, **overreacted to the recession fears** in the USA and concerns about Japan's carry trade destabilizing the markets. 

With these worries now behind us and other news having less impact, **we believe the worst is over**, and the recent decline is largely unjustified (which we saw evidence of with prices shooting back up).

We are **especially bullish on crypto moving forward** as we think it is still trading at a discount compared to stocks. 

But perhaps this is the chart that tells it all… 😏
