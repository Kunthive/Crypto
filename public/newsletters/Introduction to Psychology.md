MRI can be sued to look at the activates of the brain and what part of the brain is working for what actions. 
Apraxia - is a problem with the action 
agnosia - it is mental blindness cant recognize the things something like hard to differentiate between people.. 
Aphasia - Cant speak the language.

----
Brain as  whole
 Laterization the difference between the 2 halfs of the brain 
 left hand = right hemisphere
 right hand = left hemisphere
 Left brain = reason, logic science
 right = imagination, music, 
Contralateral organization - left hemisphere have access to the right eye and right part of thr body. and visa-versa
Corpus callosum - communicate between the 2 part of the brain 
Two brain are always are in constant contact

### **Activities Requiring Both Hemispheres**

Many daily activities involve both hemispheres working together to integrate the logical and creative aspects of a task. Some examples include:

- **Driving**: Requires spatial awareness (right brain) and decision-making (left brain).
- **Cooking**: Involves following a recipe (left brain) while also being creative with flavors and presentation (right brain).
- **Reading comprehension**: Involves interpreting words and structure (left brain) while also grasping the broader meaning and emotions conveyed (right brain).

# Mind = Brain ?
This is **Radical** 
Physical Brain goes away so does the body and the human subjectivity
Mind = computer and throught are the programs
[[Neurology]]

The hard problem of consciousness philosophical question [[Philosophy]] 

Mind = programs
